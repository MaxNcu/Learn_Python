===========

5.5.1
-----
* In command `licenses`, the output path of generated license file is truncated
  if the registration code is too long, and all the invalid characters for path
  are removed.

5.5.0
-----
* Fix issue: Warning: code object xxxx isn't wrapped (#59)
* Refine command `download`, fix some users could not download library file from pyarmor.dashingsoft.com
* Introduce advanced mode for x86/x64 arch, it has some limitations in trial version
* Add option `--advanced` for command `obfuscate`
* Add new property `advanced_mode` for project

A new feature **Advanced Mode** is introduced in this version. In this mode the
structure of PyCode_Type is changed a little to improve the security. And a hook
also is injected into Python interpreter so that the modified code objects could
run normally. Besides if some core Python C APIs are changed unexpectedly, the
obfuscated scripts in advanced mode won't work. Because this feature is highly
depended on the machine instruction set, it's only available for x86/x64 arch
now. And pyarmor maybe makes mistake if Python interpreter is compiled by old
gcc or some other `C` compiles. It's welcome to report the issue if Python
interpreter doesn't work in advanced mode.

Take this into account, the advanced mode is disabled by default. In order to
enable it, pass option `--advanced` to command `obfuscate`. But in next minor
version, this mode may be enable by default.

**Upgrade Notes**:

Before upgrading, please estimate Python interpreter in product environments to
be sure it works in advanced mode. Here is the guide

**Upgrade notes**

The capsule created in this version will include a new file

`pyshield.key`, `pyshield.lic` and `product.key`.

The old capsule which created in the earlier version still works, it
stills use the old runtime files. But it's recommended to upgrade the
old capsule to new version. Just run this command::

    pyarmor capsule --upgrade

All the license files generated for obfuscated scripts by old capsule
still work, but all the scripts need to be obfuscated again to take
new capsule effects.

in static file for core routines, they're generated in runtime.

Besides, the pre-built dynamic library for linux arm32/64 are packed

script of `py2exe` or `cx_Freeze` can bundle clear python scripts,
`pack` could pack obfuscated scripts by single command: `pyarmor
pack --type cx_Freeze /path/to/src/main.py`

Pyarmor v3.4 introduces a group new commands. For a simple package,
use command **obfuscate** to obfuscate scripts directly. For
complicated package, use Project to manage obfuscated scripts.

Project includes 2 files, one configure file and one project
capsule. Use manifest template string, same as MANIFEST.in of Python
Distutils, to specify the files to be obfuscated.

To create a project, use command **init**, use command **info** to
show project information. **config** to update project settings, and
**build** to obfuscate the scripts in the project.

Other commands, **benchmark** to metric performance, **hdinfo** to
show hardware information, so that command **licenses** can generate
license bind to fixed machine.

All the old commands **capsule**, **encrypt**, **license** are
deprecated, and will be removed from v4.

A new document [src/user-guide.md](src/user-guide.md) is written for
this new version.

3.3.1
-----
* Remove unused files in distribute package

3.3.0
-----
In this version, new obfuscate mode 7 and 8 are introduced. The main
difference is that obfuscated script now is a normal python file (.py)
other than compiled script (.pyc), so it can be used as common way.

Refer to https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor/blob/v3.3.0/src/mechanism.md

* Introduce new mode: 7, 8
* Change default mode from 3 to 8
* Change benchmark.py to test new mode

-----
* Fix issue: the traceback of an exception contains the name "<pytransform>" instead of the correct module name
* Fix issue: All the constant, co_names include function name, variable name etc still are in clear text.
  Refer to https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor/issues/5

3.2.0
-----
From this version, a new obfuscation mode is introduced. By this way,
no import hooker, no setprofile, no settrace required. The performance
of running or importing obfuscation python scripts has been remarkably
improved. It's significant for Pyarmor.

* Use this new mode as default way to obfuscate python scripts.
* Add new script "benchmark.py" to check performance in target machine: python benchmark.py
