Using PyArmor
=============

The syntax of the ``pyarmor`` command is:

    ``pyarmor`` [*command*] [*options*]

Obfuscating Python Scripts
--------------------------

Use command ``obfuscate`` to obfuscate python scripts. In the most
simple case, set the current directory to the location of your program
``myscript.py`` and execute::

    pyarmor obfuscate myscript.py

|PyArmor| obfuscates :file:`myscript.py` and all the :file:`*.py` in the same folder:

* Create :file:`.pyarmor_capsule.zip` in the ``HOME`` folder if it doesn't exists.
* Creates a folder :file:`dist` in the same folder as the script if it does not exist.
* Writes the obfuscated :file:`myscript.py` in the :file:`dist` folder.
* Writes all the obfuscated :file:`*.py` in the same folder as the script in the :file:`dist` folder.
* Copy runtime files used to run obfuscated scripts to the :file:`dist` folder.

In the :file:`dist` folder the obfuscated scripts and all the required
files are generated::

    myscript.py

    pytransform.py
    _pytransform.so, or _pytransform.dll in Windows, _pytransform.dylib in MacOS
    pytransform.key
    license.lic

The rest files called ``Runtime Files``, all of them are required to
run the obfuscated script.

Normally you name one script on the command line. It's entry
script. The content of :file:`myscript.py` would be like this::

    from pytransform import pyarmor_runtime
    pyarmor_runtime()

    __pyarmor__(__name__, __file__, b'\x06\x0f...')

The first 2 lines called ``Bootstrap Code``, are only in the entry
script. They must be run before using any obfuscated file. For all the
other obfuscated :file:`*.py`, there is only last line::

    __pyarmor__(__name__, __file__, b'\x0a\x02...')

Run the obfuscated script::

    cd dist
    python myscript.py

By default, only the :file:`*.py` in the same path as the entry script
are obfuscated. To obfuscate all the :file:`*.py` in the sub-folder
recursively, execute this command::

    pyarmor obfuscate --recursive myscript.py

Distributing Obfuscated Scripts
-------------------------------

Just copy all the files in the output path `dist` to end users. Note
that except the obfuscated scripts, all the :ref:`runtime files` need
to be distributed to end users too.

About the security of obfuscated scripts, refer to :ref:`The Security of PyArmor`

Generating License For Obfuscated Scripts
-----------------------------------------

Use command ``licenses`` to generate new :file:`license.lic` for
obfuscated scripts.

By default there is :file:`dist/license.lic` generated by command
``obfuscate``. It allows obfuscated scripts run in any machine and
never expired.

Generate an expired license for obfuscated script::

    pyarmor licenses --expired 2019-01-01 code-001

|PyArmor| generates new license file:

* Read data from :file:`.pyarmor_capsule.zip` in the ``HOME`` folder
* Create :file:`license.lic` in the ``licenses/code-001`` folder
* Create :file:`license.lic.txt` in the ``licenses/code-001`` folder

Overwrite default license with new one::

    cp licenses/code-001/license.lic dist/

Run obfuscated script with new license, It will report error after
Jan. 1, 2019::

    cd dist
    python myscript.py

Generate license to bind obfuscated scripts to fixed machine, first
get hardware information::

    pyarmor hdinfo

Then generate new license bind to harddisk serial number and mac address::

    pyarmor licenses --bind-disk "100304PBN2081SF3NJ5T" --bind-mac "20:c1:d2:2f:a0:96" code-002

Run obfuscated script with new license::

    cp licenses/code-002/license.lic dist/

    cd dist/
    python myscript.py

Extending License Type
----------------------

It's easy to extend any other licese type for obfuscated scripts: just
add authentication code in the entry script. The script can't be
changed any more after it is obfuscated, so write what ever you want
by Python. Refer to :ref:`module pytransform` for more information.

Obfuscating Single Module
-------------------------

To obfuscate one module exactly, use option `--exact`::

    pyarmor obfuscate --exact foo.py

Only :file:`foo.py` is obfuscated, now import this obfuscated module::

    cd dist
    python -c "import foo"

Obfuscating Whole Package
-------------------------

Run the following command to obfuscate a package::

    pyarmor obfuscate --recursive --output dist/mypkg mykpg/__init__.py

To import the obfuscated package::

    cd dist
    python -c "import mypkg"

Packing Obfuscated Scripts
--------------------------

Use command ``pack`` to pack obfuscated scripts into the bundle.

First install `PyInstaller`::

    pip install pyinstaller

Set the current directory to the location of your program
``myscript.py`` and execute::

    pyarmor pack myscript.py

|PyArmor| packs :file:`myscript.py`:

* Execute ``pyarmor obfuscate`` to obfuscate :file:`myscript.py`
* Execute ``pyinstaller myscipt.py`` to create :file:`myscript.spec`
* Update :file:`myscript.spec`, replace original scripts with obfuscated ones
* Execute ``pyinstaller myscript.spec`` to  bundle the obfuscated scripts

In the ``dist/myscript`` folder you find the bundled app you
distribute to your users.

Run the final executeable file::

    dist/myscript/myscript

Check the scripts have been obfuscated. It should return error::

    rm dist/myscript/license.lic
    dist/myscript/myscript

Generate an expired license for the bundle::

    pyarmor licenses --expired 2019-01-01 code-003
    cp licenses/code-003/license.lic dist/myscript

    dist/myscript/myscript

For complicated cases, refer to command :ref:`pack` and :ref:`How to
pack obfuscated scripts`.
