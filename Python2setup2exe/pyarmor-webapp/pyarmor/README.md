# Pyarmor

Pyarmor is a command line tool used to import or run encrypted python
scripts. Only by a few extra files, pyarmor can run and imported
encrypted files in the normal python environments.

Pyarmor just likes an enhancement which let python could run or import
encrypted files.

## Main Features

- Run encrypted script or import encrypted module
- Run or import encrypted compiled python files (.pyc, .pyo)
- Mixed encrypted files with normal python files.
- Expire encrypted files
- Bind encrypted files to harddisk, mac address, ip etc.

## Support Platforms

- Python 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 and Python3

- Prebuilt Platform: win32, win_amd64, linux_i386, linux_x86_64, macosx_intel

- Embeded Platform: [Raspberry Pi](http://pyarmor.dashingsoft.com/downloads/platforms/raspberrypi/_pytransform.so),
  [Banana Pi](http://pyarmor.dashingsoft.com/downloads/platforms/bananapi/_pytransform.so)

The core of [Pyarmor] is written by C, the only dependency is libc. So
it's not difficult to build for any other platform, even for embeded
system. Contact <jondy.zhao@gmail.com> if you'd like to run encrypted
scripts in other platform.
