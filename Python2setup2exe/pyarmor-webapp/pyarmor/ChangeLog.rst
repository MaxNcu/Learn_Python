3.3.0
-----
In this version, new obfuscate mode 7 and 8 are introduced. The main
difference is that obfuscated script now is a normal python file (.py)
other than compiled script (.pyc), so it can be used as common way. 

Refer to https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor/blob/v3.3.0/src/mechanism.md

* Introduce new mode: 7, 8
* Change default mode from 3 to 8
* Change benchmark.py to test new mode
* Update webapp and tutorial
* Update usage 
* Fix issue of py2exe, now py2exe can work with python scripts obfuscated by pyarmor
* Fix issue of odoo, now odoo can load python modules obfuscated by pyarmor

3.2.1
-----
* Fix issue: the traceback of an exception contains the name "<pytransform>" instead of the correct module name
* Fix issue: All the constant, co_names include function name, variable name etc still are in clear text.
  Refer to https://github.com/dashingsoft/pyarmor/issues/5

3.2.0
-----
From this version, a new obfuscation mode is introduced. By this way,
no import hooker, no setprofile, no settrace required. The performance
of running or importing obfuscation python scripts has been remarkably
improved. It's significant for Pyarmor.

* Use this new mode as default way to obfuscate python scripts.
* Add new script "benchmark.py" to check performance in target machine: python benchmark.py
* Change option "--bind-disk" in command "license",  now it must be have a value

3.1.7
-----
* Add option "--bind-mac", "--bind-ip", "--bind-domain" for command "license"

3.1.3
-----
A web gui interface is introduced as Pyarmor WebAppï¼Œ and support MANIFEST.in

* In encrypt command, save encrypted scripts with same file structure of source.
* Add a web gui interface for pyarmor.
* Support MANIFEST.in to list files for command encrypt

It's a milestone for Pyarmor, from this version, use ctypes import
dynamic library of core functions, other than by python extensions

Besides, in this version, a big change which make Pyarmor could avoid
soure script got by c debugger.

* Use ctypes load core library other than python extentions which need
  built for each python version.
* "\__main__" block not running in encrypted script.
